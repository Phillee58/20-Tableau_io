        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        I created this data viz as a homework assignment at UC Davis Professional and Continuing 
        Education's <a href="https://bootcamp.ucdavis.edu/data/"><strong>Data Analytics Bootcamp.</strong></a> 
        <br><br>    

        Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data"><strong>data on the program's utilization.</strong></a> Through the team's efforts, 
            each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on their site.
            I exported the csv files from their site, then combined the monthly .csv's into four combined .csv files (2016 - 2019). 
            I was then able to create a union of the four .csv files in Tableau as my data source.

            <h5>VOLUME DASHBOARD</h5>
            This dashboard shows the volume of bike trips between 2016 - 2019. You can see that the volume of trips has increased every year. 
            Summer and fall are the quarters/months were the volume is the highest. That's pretty obvious because no one wants to ride a bike in the middle of the winter in NYC.

            <h5>DURATION DASHBOARD</h5>
            This dashboard shows the average time for each bike trip between 2016 - 2019. The average time has slightly reducted of the fours years. 
            Again, in summer and fall quarters/months riders had higher average times of trips than the winter months.

            <h5>START STATION DASHBOARD</h5>
            Start stations are where the bike trip started. This dashboard shows a map of the highest volume start stations and bar charts that 
            sort the most popular and least populart start stations. Stations. Five stations had very high volues of starts. This may be very popular stations or they 
            may be outliers. Further investigation would be necessary.

            End stations are where the bike trip ended and returned. This dashboard shows a map of the highest volume end stations and bar charts 
            that sort the most popular and least populart end stations. Stations. Five stations also had very high volues of starts. This may be very popular stations or they 
            may be outliers. Further investigation would be necessary.

            <h5>RIDERS STORY</h5>
            This story looks at demographics for riders and bikes. The average age has decreased from 39.6 to 37.5 years over the four years. 
            I suppose they are now less older bike riders. Males outnumber females two to one and both genders are seeing ridership increase. 
            I was also able to crown the "King of the Bikes", by showing which bike had the most trips over the four year period.
